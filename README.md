**Overview figure of the study.** Figure 1. Overview of the study. A) Genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from patients with B) nine incident or prevalent complex diseases and age/sex matched controls were C1) analysed using cross-validation and holdout test datasets, and C2) A polygenic risk score was computed for genomic data, while D) feature selection was performed for proteomics and metabolomics. E1) A machine learning model was trained and tested to E2) construct an interactive atlas that can be found at macd.shinyapps.io/ShinyApp/. F) In summary, we present a head-to-head comparison of different omics layers, and an interactive atlas to derive context-dependent types and numbers of potential biomarkers for incidence and prevalence of the diseases
