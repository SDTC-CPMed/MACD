## General information

This is a github page dedicated to a manuscript TODO:link. The aim of the manuscript was to create an interactive multiomic atlas for complex diseases, which is available at TODO: link.

## Overview

TODO include figure

**Overview figure of the study.** Figure 1. Overview of the study. A) Genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data from patients with B) nine complex diseases from UKBB were divided by the disease status and C) analysed using cross-validation and holdout test dataset. D) A polygenic risk score was computed for genomic data while E) Feature selection was performed for proteomics and metabolomics. F) A logistic regression model with ridge penalty was trained and tested to create G) an interactive atlas that can be found at TODO: link. H) We present a head-to-head comparison of different omics, platform to analyse the results, and potential biomarkers for the incidence and prevalence of the diseases
